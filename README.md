The project is split into three parts.

Generate an interesting maze using DFS searching algorithm while providing a maze saluting for one of each searching algorithm, BreadthFirstSearch,
DepthFirstSearch and BestFirstSearch.

Using client-server and multi threaded architectures to allow multiple clients to operate in parallel. Furthermore,
the server and client use compression and decompression methods to send and receive requests that create and solve mazes.

The program includes GUI designing (using JavaFX), and adding many features such as choosing the generating & solving algorithms, choosing game-soundtrack, save & load old mazes, etc.
In addition, the program is designed according to the MVVM architecture.
We used Log4j2 to save logs of various operations performed on the system.
